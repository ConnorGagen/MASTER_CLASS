## Installing nextflow locally on a mac (similar for PC)

#1: First we need to determine if you have a JAVA version between 11-21
If you aren't sure you can download it here for free:

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
I chose this one: Install Java 21 (DMG) for MacOS
Follow instructions in the "disk image" or .DMG downloaded


#2: Let's get Nextflow installed in our bin directory

Find a place you want to make a "bin" folder that has
open permissions so you don't need a password to change it.

For MacOS the main directory is /Users/<computer_name>

I am going to install nextflow in: Users/rinnadmin

# Let's install Nextflow Locally MacOS!
```{bash installing nextflow}

cd Users/<your folder>

# make a bin directory
mkdir bin

# move into bin folder
cd bin

#install nextflow
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
# or
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# NOTE: curl and wget are bash commands to go grab stuff from websites
# MORE INFO on variations of nextflow installs if you want differnet versions etc

```

# Finding the $PATH
Awesome we now have nextflow installed - and probably a new JAVA :)
Yet we need to have your computer know where to speak nextflow
$PATH tells your computer where to look for languages and commands

So all we need to do is add nextflow to the $PATH

# Adding nextflow to the $PATH
```{bash adding nextflow to our $PATH}

#let's see what is in our $PATH
echo $PATH

# hmmm : seperated data - let's make that easier to read with "tr"
echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"
# Nice much easier to see all the places the $PATH leads

# Now we need to use a bash "text editor" nano to add the path to $PATH
# sudo just gives us permissions to do so - you will need to type in pswd
sudo nano /etc/paths.d/nextflow

# now add the nextflow file path to $PATH
# type in :
/Users/rinnadmin/bin
# or 
/Users/<folder_you_chose>/bin

# Now just quit the session and open new terminal and type:
nextflow -version 

# You should get the version number - if not .. it's not installed

```
