```{r setup, include=FALSE}

options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
        dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE,
        tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
```

Let's start with some of the very basics of BASH to navigate servers and your command line:

Youtube video for this class is here :
https://youtu.be/yqENuEzE1KY

# First commands:
cd - to change directories
ls - list the files
pwd - tells you the pathway you are currently at (very useful actually!)

```{BASH}

cd /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/
ls
pwd

# Wait could there be more? let's try:

ls -lah
```
-l for long
-a for all
-h human readable
Basically I typically always use these flags


# let's create your directory

```{BASH}
cd /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/

mkdir NAME_of_dir

# This is your new home where we will be working all of class !
cd NAME_of_dir

```

# Every function has a manual entry (man)
```{BASH}

man mkdir
# Press q to escape

```

Now let's make a new file using touch

```{Bash}

touch test.txt
ls

```
woah a new file shows up! What is in it? lets use Nano

```{Bash}

nano test.txt
# type whatever
# ctrl x, Y for yes -- then enter -- to exit nano

```

Now let's take a look at the file with cat

```{Bash}
cat test.txt

# here are the top 10 lines

head -10 test.txt

# bottom lines

tail -10 test.txt
```


Let's make another file and combine two files
This is done by the "cat" command

```{BASH}

# First let's test the remove command (using rm command) for the test.txt file 
# then let's make a new one.

# removing test.txt
rm test.txt

# making new test.txt file with nano
touch test.txt
nano test.txt
"add whatever text"

```

Now we will make a second file and merge the two files into one file with cat.

```{BASH}

nano test2.txt
# type whatever

# merging the two files
cat test.txt test2.txt > test3.txt

# let's see what we get with "cat"
cat test3.txt

```

let's move the files to a new file path
Note that the file is not copied just moved to a new file path

```{Bash}

# making directory to move the files
mkdir practice

# moving the files
mv test2.txt practice
mv test3.txt practice
mv test.txt practice

# let's see what we have with "ls"
ls

# Alternatively If we want to copy the file we can use "cp"
# note that if you use "cp" the file will be duplicated whereas "mv" just chanes the file path.

cp test2.txt /practice

# note simply changes file path and cp recreates the entire directory.

```

Nice and tidy. However that could be quite laborious if you wanted to move a bunch of files. So we can use WILDCARDS

# more information on wild cards can be found here:
http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html

```{BASH}

# let's start with with the wild card "*" which means anything that has that text in the name
# This will move any file that ends in .txt the star means anything counts.

mv *.txt practice

# what happened? let's use "ls"
ls

```

Now let's say you want to move the files back to the original directory:

```{BASH}

cd practice
# note that "../" means one directory above the current one and "../../" prefix means two dir above
mv *.txt ../
```

Imagine how much time one uses typing long file paths in the terminal. For example, in this class we will be using:

/Shares/rinn_class/data/CLASS_2021

That is no fun to type every time and then go to the directory of interest. 

Good news there is a solution (used by nextflow and just how useful later) its called a sym-link and you have probably used them before as all URLs on the internet are sym-links. 

Let's make a sym-link to the class folder in your home directory 

```{BASH}

cd ~/
# or some directory you use a lot on your local computer

# creating a sym link with "ln -s /file_path
ln -s /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2022/<identikey> CLASS 

# what happened
ls

```

Now you see a simlink called CLASS. You just cd CLASS and voila you are in class :)

Another handy short cut is to see how big a folder is. 
Often you are downloading to or working on a folder and need to see if it became bigger or smaller. 
This is best done wtih disk usage "du"

```{BASH}
# change file path to home directory
cd ~/
  
# checking on the size of this directory 
du -sh ~/
  
```

The -sh flag is for "s"ummary and "h"uman readable


|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The pipe
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||


The pipe and xargs are two of the most elegant aspects of BASH. Let's try something
simple, so simple it may end up being used quite often :)

Many times a folder you are indexing may have hundreds or thousands of files.
There is no way we want to count them manually. So we can use the pipe to list (ls) 
the files in a directory and pipe it to word count (wc) to count the number of files.

Let's see:

```{BASH}

cd ~/
ls | wc -l

```
Here the list output becomes the standard input to the word count owing to the pipe.
Or the pipe passed along the standard output of ls to standard input of wc. The 
-l flag is for the line count.
